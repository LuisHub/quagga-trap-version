Quagga is free software that manages various IPv4 and IPv6 routing
protocols.

This version works in the same way as original Quagga routing suite, but it has a little modification.

This Quagga is able to send an alert when a route/net is added or deleted from the device kernel.

The alert is sent using Simple Network Management Protocol (snmptrap) with the params about the route/net, to a destination that you can choose using a configuration file.

When a new version of original Quagga is released, this version will also be release in a few days later
